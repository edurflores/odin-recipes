            <li>2 cups strong black coffee</li>
            <li>1/2 cup marsala</li>
            <li>3 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1/3 cup caster sugar</li>
            <li>250 mascarpone</li>
            <li>300 ml thickened cream, lightly whipped</li>
            <li>1 large packet of sponge finger biscuits (savoiardi)</li>
            <li>Cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour coffee and marsala into a shallow dish. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar in a large bowl with electric beaters until pale and thick. 
                Add the mascarpone and whipped cream, mixing gently until just combined. 
            </li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a medium bowl with electric beaters until soft peaks form. 
                Using a large metal spoon, gently fold eggwhites into mascarpone mixture.
            </li>
            <li>Dip enough biscuits into coffee mixture to cover the base of a 19cm square ceramic dish.
                Cover the biscuits with one-third of the mascarpone mixture. Repeat layers 2 times, ending with the cream.
                Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Dust generously with cocoa powder and serve.
